Feature: dummy API consumption
  I want to interact with the dummy api through the common verbs


  @CreateNewRecord
  Scenario: Create new record in database
    Given Andres wants to be able to test common API verbs
    When you create the information required to get the new data of an employee
    Then you need to validate the created data of the employee.
